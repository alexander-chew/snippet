The snippets saved here are used for Sublime Text.

Steps to create a snippet (I use MacBook):

1. Open Sublime Text and click on the `Tools` section.
2. Go to `Developer/New Snippet...`.
3. You can create new snippets based on the [snippets folder](https://github.com/alexander-chew/snippet/tree/main).
4. Open `Users/alexander/Library` in Finder. (My username in the MacBook is `alexander`)
5. Open `Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/User`, where the `Preferences.sublime-settings` is stored.
6. Finally, save the snippet and move the snippet into the `User` folder.
